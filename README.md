# Electron Hello World

A quick way to get a Hello World Electron app running locally.

**Update**: looks like the Atom team has created [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start), a similarly inspired endeavor! Please use that instead.

**No longer supported or maintained. Use at your own risk.**

## How To

### 1. clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:ngoldman/electron-hello-world.git
```

### 2. `cd` into the repo directory and run `npm install`
